## Dependent and Independent Variables

A dependent variable is one whose output or reaction depends on another variable, known as an independent variable. 
The dependent variable is the one of interest in research. 
The independent variable is not influenced by another variable.
The dependent variable is influenced.

For example, perhaps I wish to determine how my kitten's mood (variable 1) is affected by a sudden thunderstorm (variable 2). My kitten's mood is affected by the outside variable of the thunderstorm outside. The thunderstorm is not affected by my kitten's mood. Nor can I affect a change on the weather.
